    "In this tutorial we will use Jupyter Notebook as an interface for `Python`, therefore a quick intro is given.  If you know are familiar with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab you can skip this tutorial.  If you want to learn more, there are some useful __Resources__ at the bottom of this page.\n",

    "`Jupyter` is a project to develop open-source software, and `Jupyter` __Notebook__ is their first web-based and user-friendly interface between `Python` and the user.  The new version is _JupyterLab_, but we will use __Notebook__ as the `mybinder` project uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter` __Notebook__ is more than interactive coding - meaning you write and execute part of your code and receive immediate response. `Jupyter` __Notebook__ also allows you to add formatted text, equations and figures - this let you keep code, info, and results, including figures, neatly organized and visualize them on the same page. It also allows others to reproduce your results. \n",

    "__The dashboard:__ The main page you see in your browser when you open `Jupyter` __Notebook__, and it lists your files and directories. Clicking on a file will open it on a new tab. (__Note__ that `Jupyter` __Notebook__ `Python` files have the extension .ipynb)\n",

    "## The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "Scripts are divided into cells - code lines that are ran (executed) as a unit and will return the output or results from your code immediately. Cells are not independent of the rest: if you assigned or modified variables in a cell, you do have access to those in following ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell you have few options:\n",
    "- Press __Shift-Return__ (run cell and move to the next one) or __Command-Return__ (run cell and stay in the current oone) \n",
    "- Click the Run __[>|]__ icon on the Icon menu\n",
    "- Go to the Top menu -> Cells -> Run Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected cell is highlighted by a thick color side bar, and to edit the cell, you'll have to double click on it and a color outline will appear around the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of cells: Code and Markdown\n",
    "__Markdown__ cells contain formatted text, like this cell, while __Code__ cells contain code to be executed and in many cases return an output. The text within a __Code__ cell shows different colors, depending on the function (operation, variable, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the type of cell:\n",
    "- On the __Icon menu__: in the middle (or the next to last element if running locally on your own computer) of this menu there is a drop-down menu that shows the type and allows you to change it\n",
    "- Press __Esc__ and then __m__ (to change to Markdown type) or __y__ (to change to Code type)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressing __Esc__ allows you access to keyboard commands (you can see them all from the Top Menu -> Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy-pasting, adding and deleting cells\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the last cell using __Shift-Return__, a new cell is added automoatically bellow, but sometimes we need to add a cell in between cells, delete one, or make a copy of the current one. For this, you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the __Icon menu__: __+__ for adding a cell, __scissors__ to cut, __( )__ to copy, and __clipboard__ to paste\n",
    "- Keyboard commands: press __Esc__ and then: __a__ or __b__ for inserting a cell (above or below), __d d__ to delete a cell, __c__ to copy, __x__ to cut, and __p__ to paste cell below. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "__Test this:__ Double click in the next cell to edit mode and then run the cell using one of the options above. Also try changing between __Markdown__ and __Code__ modes, re-running the cell to see the differences."
